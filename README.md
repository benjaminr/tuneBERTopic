# Tune BERTopic

This library provides optimisation search strategies for evaluating the best hyperparameters for BERTopic models.

It currently implements a Bayesian approach, minimising the inverse of the topic coherence.

There are plans to include additional search strategies and evaluation metrics in future versions.
